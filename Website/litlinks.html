					<BR>
					<B>"Small Press Distribution is a non-profit (501(c)3) literary arts organization located in Berkeley, California. Our mission is to nurture a cultural context in which the literary arts are valued and sustained, and we accomplish this mission by providing wholesaling services to independent presses and through our public programs and advocacy efforts. We believe that the written word, in its most eloquent form, deserves the broadest possible distribution.
					<BR><BR>
					Founded in 1969, we are the only wholesaler in the country dedicated exclusively to independently published literature. SPD gives the public access to the broad spectrum of literature published today by distributing books to bookstores, libraries, and readers. We take risks on exciting new writers, enabling their work to develop an audience and gain recognition in the marketplace."</B>

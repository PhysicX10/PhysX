			<h3>Trimester 1</h3>
			<div>
				<h3 align = "center"> WRITING </h3>
			</div>
			<p>Welcome to English Nine. This trimester we focus on writing. You will write often and in a variety of styles. Exercises will range from close observation and detailed description, to journal entries and character sketches, to the writing of dialogue and poetry. All exercises are designed to help you develop a facility for putting your ideas on paper.</p>
			<p>The goals for this trimester are for you to develop an engaged, honest, and artful writing style, to present your ideas and observations with clarity and precision, to find and develop your personal voice in writing, and to identify a set of strategies for writing effectively in the future.</p>
			<p>Another important goal is for you to develop constructive modes for talking about your work and the work of others. </p>
			<p>I will serve as your editor and sounding board, and general mentor. Your peers will also function in these capacities.</p>
			<p>You will write every day, both in class and at home, and in a variety of styles and contexts. Exercises will be drawn from a number of different writing textbooks. You will keep all of your work in a single portfolio folder. I will review and respond to your writing throughout the trimester.</p>
			<p>Re-writing is crucial to developing your ideas and your skills. You will be asked to edit and re-write your pieces often.</p>

				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A native New Yorker, Dr. Casdin received his B.A. in English from Columbia University and his Ph.D. in English from Stanford University. Trained as a scholar in British eighteenth-century and Romantic literature, his other interests include memoirs and autobiographies, modern literary experiments in prose and poetry, and film studies. During his years at Stanford, Dr. Casdin helped found the literary journal Mantis and organized a university-wide poetry reading series that included readings by the late Nobel Prize-winning poet Czeslaw Milosz and former U.S. Poet Laureate Robert Hass. He has taught Freshman English and advanced honors tutorials at Stanford, and joins the faculty at Horace Mann after having taught AP British Literature and English 10 at the Castilleja School in Palo Alto. Dr. Casdin lives in New York City with his wife and two daughters.

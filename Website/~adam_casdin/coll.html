			<h3>Trimester 1</h3>
			<div>
				<h3 align = "center"> What is Poetry </h3>
				<p align = "center">The Americans of all nations at any time upon the earth have probably the fullest poetical nature. The United States themselves are essentially the greatest poem.</p>
				<p align = "right">--Walt Whitman, "Preface" to Leaves of Grass (1855)</p>
			</div>
			<p>The title for my course poses a question for which there is no answer; or, for which answers are continually being generated. What is poetry? That depends upon whom you ask. This trimester we will examine answers from a broad range of poets, analyzing the various forms poetry can take, and the wildly different ideas, images, and feelings that can be expressed through it. We will read and talk about sonnets and odes, ballads and calligrams, conversational and concrete poems. Through close analysis of these works, you will build up a critical vocabulary for talking about poetry, and develop your critical thinking skills. Yet the reading, both in class and at home, is perhaps the most important element of the course. That reading culminates with our experience of the long first section of Walt Whitman's first edition of The Leaves of Grass . In addition to assigned works, we will spend a portion of each class reading and discussing poems drawn from The Best American Poetry 2004, ed. by Lyn Hejinian. </p>

					<p><b>Eliot Weinberger on <a href="http://poetshouse.org/progpoetics.htm">Poetry and Translation in the 21st Century</a>: A talk given at Poets House in 2002.</b></p>
					<p>Eliot Weinberger is best known as the primary translator of poet Octavio Paz, and of dissident Chinese poet Bei Dao. Weinberger is also a widely published literary and cultural critic.

					<p><b><i><a href="http://www.writing.upenn.edu/~wh/boring.html">Being Boring</a></i> by Kenneth Goldsmith</b></p>
					<p>Poet and critic Kenneth Goldsmith, the 2004 Fellow in Poetics & Poetic Practice at UPenn's Center for Programs in Contemporary Writing, meditates on the aesthetic category he calls the "unboring boring." While at UPenn, Goldsmith taught a course in <i><a href="http://writing.upenn.edu/cw/courses04c.html#111.301">Uncreative Writing.</a></i>  His premise? "It's clear that long-cherished notions of creativity are under attack, eroded by file-sharing, media culture, widespread sampling, and digital replication. How does writing respond to this new environment?" Goldsmith hosts a weekly radio show on WFMU and is creator and curator of <a href="http://www.ubu.com">UbuWeb</a>.</p>

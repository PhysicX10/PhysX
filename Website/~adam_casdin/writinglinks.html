            <B>Purdue's OWL is perhaps the oldest and most well respected online
            writing lab. The site offers help with the mechanics of writing.
            Though developed for university students, the writing guides are
            useful for
            writers
      at all levels. See the "Handouts and Materials" section, especially the area on "General Writing Concerns" 
      (broken into the subheadings "Effective Writing," "Revising/Editing/Proofreading," and "Types/Genres of Writing") 
      and "Grammar, spelling, and punctuation" (which includes grammar exercises).</B>

      <B>A very basic (basic is sometimes good!) grammar from the University

      like the
      easy-to-search "Definitions" section.</B>

<B>As the website states, &quot;Confusing Words is a collection of 3210 words that are troublesome to readers and writers. Words are grouped according to the way they are most often confused or misused. Some of these words are homonyms (words that sound alike but are spelled differently) and some are just commonly  confused.&quot;</B>

<H3><U>Rhetoric</U></H3>
<B>Rhetoric is the art of persuasion in public speaking. In short, rhetoric offers tools and effective strategies for coordinating 
<U>what</U> we say with <U>how</U> we say it. Formal rhetoric instruction dates back to Greek and Roman times. 
In the nineteenth century, notably at Harvard University, classical rhetoric was employed for the teaching of writing. 
Today, though instruction in rhetoric has generally fallen out of favor, some university and college writing programs, including 


<A HREF="http://www.stanford.edu/group/pwr/" target="_blank">Stanford University's</A>, 
have again turned to rhetorical models of persuasion to help students form strong written arguments.</B>

<B>This site offers a fantastic introduction to all aspects of rhetoric, including descriptions of its component parts, explanations of 
the styles of rhetorical arguments, definitions of key rhetorical terms, or "figures," (such as, "metaphor," "synechdoche," 
and "apostrophe"), and concrete examples of these styles and terms put into practice.</B>
